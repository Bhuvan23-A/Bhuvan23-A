CS Undergrad | Exploring Machine Learning
-----------------------------------------

I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in Machine Learning and a constant eagerness to learn new things. I enjoy exploring new concepts, understanding how algorithms work, and building a solid foundation through hands-on practice.

I am open to experimenting with different ideas, tools, and approaches, and I believe in learning by doing. As I continue exploring Machine Learning and related areas, I aim to steadily improve my skills and understanding through consistent effort and curiosity.
